Used following command:
python directoryScriptForMoleculeDistance.py /home/kazutoshi/c2tm/C2tm/deNovo_Models/master_searches/matches_1_params.txt /home/kazutoshi/c2tm/C2tm/deNovo_Models/c2tm_bbmodels

To determine the best canidates for c2tm master searches - stored in
250cutoffMatch_DistMatrix.txt

Based on high match value to naturally occruning pdbs, and a low distance between CA' The selceted pdb were:
c2tm_bbmodels/00642.c083f221a8a8.allbb.pdb
c2tm_bbmodels/00132.c083f221a8a8.allbb.pdb

# mini642
./create PDS with mini 642 and used the databae provied by MM
 ./master --bbRMSD --rmsdCut .5 --targetList master_db.list.txt

I converted master sequence utput files to fasta multiple sequence alignmetn files
python aaScript.py /home/kazutoshi/c2tm/bb_624/mini_642.seq >> weblogo.fasta

Using weblogo.fasta to make weblogos with different RMSD cutoffs using aaScript.py

Using the weblogo we determined that the 6,13, and 20 positions could be Gly, and the other positions did not have a strong signature for any particular residue

06/27/17

Converted the pdb of 00642.c083f221a8a8.allbb.pdb to contain Cys at all positions besides 6,13, and 20. Then added Asp to create a CCDDCDG pattern for the amino acid residues: where C are positions where the residue would be less likely to interact with the helix.


# picked random sequence for exterior residues using script:
python bin/mm/memMaker.py 642mutatedCysAsp.pdb >> fresh.txt


# 06/28/17

Replaced 642mutatedCysAsp.pdb with corresponding aa denoted in fresh.txt using pymol and saved as c2tmDesigned642.pdb

Created a PDB with only 1st 4 aa of Chain A and last four of Chain B called:
c2tmDesigned642Looped.pdb

Ran Master program to find loops that fit the query:
c2tmDesigned642Looped.pdb

Using Script:
/home/gpu/jam_data/CTM2/master --query /home/gpu/jam_data/CTM2/c2tmDesigned642Looped.pds --targetList /home/gpu/Desktop/mm_162901_SCmasterDB/v2_162901_bc_30-scPDB/list2.txt --rmsdCut 1.0 --matchOut c2tmDesigned642Looped.match --seqOut c2tmDesigned642Looped.seq --structOut c2tmDesigned642Looped.struct --topN 5000

Created a set of PDBs (top 5000) that contains a loop which may be better suited for our designed helical proteins.
 

Using script:
python /home/gpu/jam_data/CTM2/bin/mm/loopFinder.py /home/gpu/jam_data/CTM2/c2tmDesigned642Looped.pdb /home/gpu/jam_data/CTM2/c2tmDesigned642Looped.match /home/gpu/Desktop/mm_162901_SCmasterDB/v2_162901_bc_30-scPDB_oPDB /home/gpu/jam_data/CTM2/c2tmDesigned642Looped.struct >> loopSequenceMatches.8_Gap2_8.txt


An output of the helical and loop sequences with the count of the loop length and corresponding pdb and the residues denoted in the text file



06/30/17

Used the output file :loopSequenceMatches.8_Gap2_8.txt ran script -- 
python aaFrequencySorting.py loopSequenceMatches.8_Gap2_8.txt >> sortedLoopSequenceMatches.8_Gap2_8.txt
to create a sorted file by loop length

Created a file with loop sequences of length 4 and 8, loopSequence4.txt and loopSequence8.txt
Used script:

To determine the frequency of AA at specific positions used script:
python AAarray.py loopSequence4.txt >> positional_arrays4sequences.txt

Then using the script:

python frequencyAAScript.py positional_arrays4sequences.txt
A print of frequencies can be outputted 

Using pymol for analysis, determined that loopMatch514 passed trhough the most positions of the matching pdbs.
